# React

Dishare APP: http://www.dishareapp.com/ (It looks best on mobile)

- Currently, I am working on the web development of a platform named Dishare, which helps restaurants digitize their menus in a savory visual format. And the main technics involved in are REACT & Bulma for the front-end, Node.js, Express and MongoDB for the back-end.<br /><br />

- Property Listing Project: An interactive map with property listings using React.js and Google Maps API.<br />
  
  Functions:
  
   1) use React with Google Maps API.
   2) filter data based on multiple criteria.
   3) render custom markers
   4) highlight active property in the list and on the map
   5) render custom markers based on a property location
   6) sort cards by price
   7) instantly update visible cards and markers on the map
   8) scroll to a related card in the list view <br /><br />
      
 
Thanks for reviewing.
