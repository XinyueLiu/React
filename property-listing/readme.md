# React Workshop - Property Listing

This zip file contains starting files for the Property Listing project.

## Getting started
1. Open `01-Start` folder in VSCode or any other code editor
2. Navigate to `01-Start` in the terminal (build into VSCode or any other you like:)
3. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to spin up webpack dev server
5. Open `http://localhost:8080` in the browser and follow step by step

## Other files
`02-Final` folder includes files **at the end of each video**. Most of these folders include files that have been changed in the individual videos.

Feel free to use them for comparison or replace them with your own files if you get stuck.

**Happy coding!**
